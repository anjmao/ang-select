## Angular native ui-select
See [Demos](https://ng-select.github.io/#/forms) or try in [Plunker](https://plnkr.co/edit/V5tFfNY28fiaLlNwvcWb?p=preview)

## Warning
Library is under active development and may not work as expected until stable 1.0.0 release.

## Getting started
After installing the above dependencies, install `ng-select` via:
```shell
npm install --save @ng-select/ng-select
```
Once installed you need to import our main module:
```js
import {NgSelectModule} from '@ng-select/ng-select';
```
The only remaining part is to list the imported module in your application module.:
```js
import {NgSelectModule} from '@ng-select/ng-select';

@NgModule({
  declarations: [AppComponent, ...],
  imports: [NgSelectModule, ...],  
  bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})
export class AppModule {
}
```
### SystemJS
If you are using SystemJS, you should also adjust your configuration to point to the UMD bundle.

In your systemjs config file, `map` needs to tell the System loader where to look for `ng-select`:
```js
map: {
  '@ng-select/ng-select': 'node_modules/@ng-select/ng-select/bundles/ng-select.umd.js',
}
```
